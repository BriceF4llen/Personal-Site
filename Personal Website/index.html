               Welcome to my personal website! Allow me the opportunity to introduce myself along with some of my work to you. I hope you enjoy the page and please feel free to get in touch!

               <p>I'm fortunate enough to call two places home. I'm even more fortunate that they're both in Texas. Garland and Lubbock are my stomping grounds and I'm proud of my roots in both of these beautiful parts of Texas. For all it's faults, Texas is truly a very charming place. Y'all come visit now ya' hear?! </p>

               <p>I come from the most unlikely family imagineable considering who I've grown to be. I'm the product of an extended lineage of cotton farmers and ranchers on both sides. My dad is a small town banker and my mom works in health insurance. For me, family has and will always come first.</p>

I am a HUGE fan of Udemy and YouTube. They're great places to learn almost anything and they're also laughably affordable or free!</p>

           <p class="long-copy">
               When I'm not tinkering with my projects, you'll most likely catch me dabbling in one of my four favorite hobbies. #CodeLife can be draining, but these are just a few of the things in life that give me my energy back.

               <h3>Fishing</h3>
               <p>Fishing is a blast and can be an inexpensive hobby. All it really takes is one rod, one reel, and enough tackle to last the trip. Fishing is my favorite medium for staying in touch with nature and enjoying the outdoors. </p>

               <p>Nothing is more thrilling than keeping up with the rapidly evolving crypto-space. The interproject drama, value explosions or collapses, and technological achievements are all of particular interest to me. </p>

               <p>Dallas Cowboys, Buffalo Bills, Red Raiders and the Texas Longhorns are my teams! I don't often scream at the TV, but when I do it's likely because the O-line keeps letting somebody hit my Quarterback.</p>

               <p>Food is family and friendship. Some of life's best moments happen over a plate of nachos at the game or a backyard burger at a buddy's house. I love to cook so I'm always looking for friends who like to eat.</p>

       <div class="row technology">
           <div class="col span-1-of-2 tech-text">
                <p>I'm recently graduated and working in industry at my first job with 3M. But I am currently looking for more challenging work that will offer me new growth opportunities. I've had exposure to a little bit of everything, and for now my primary objective is to hunt for a fresh opportunity to apply those skills to help build new and useful services and technologies that will impact the lives of every day folk.</p>

                <p>It's hard to say I'm an expert at any one thing. I like to think of my self as the Jack of all technical trades. Rather than trying to convey the extent of my technical expertise over my personal website, allow me instead to convey the tools of the trade I most enjoy working with.</p>
           </div>
           <div class="col span-1-of-2 tech-text">
                <p>Since graduation, I've been self training as an entry level developer. Below are mostly technologies I've had a fair amount of exposure to and tinker with regularly, but also a hand full of technologies I'm currently learning and plan on being more competent with in the future. My curiosity is insatiable so I'm almost always getting my hands dirty with something new.</p>

                <p>The most interesting areas I'm pursuing are Big Data, Machine Learning, and Blockchain technology. Data Science is our means of deriving valuable insights from data so vast it's impossible to navigate. And the only thing more awesome than a well oiled digital machine is one that can grow itself.</p>

               <h3>Waldo</h3>
               <p>Waldo was my Senior Capstone Project in college. It's a GPS prototype that utilizes an array of other instrument modules on an Arduino microcontroller to log travel measurements into a .CSV file. The utilities are endless, but I utilize it to walk my dog and record his speeds and map the path we took.</p>
