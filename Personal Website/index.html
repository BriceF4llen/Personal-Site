               <p>I'm fortunate enough to call two places home. I'm even more fortunate that they're both in Texas. Garland and Lubbock are my stomping grounds and I'm proud to come from them both. For all of it's faults, Texas is truly a very charming place. Y'all come visit now ya' hear?! </p>

               When I'm not grinding out some code, you'll most likely catch me dabbling in one of my four favorite hobbies. #CodeLife can be draining, but these are some of the things in life that give me my energy back again.

               <h3>Fishing</h3>
               <p>Fishing is a blast and can be a very inexpensive hobby. All it takes is one rod, one reel, and enough tackle to last the trip. Fishing is my favorite medium for staying connected with nature. </p>

                <p>I'm a recent graduate looking for an entry level position that will offer diversified experience and plenty of opportunities to apply my skills. I've had exposure to a little bit of everything, so now I'm looking for an industry opportunity to apply those skills to help build new and useful services and technologies that will impact the lives of every day folk.</p>
                <p>It's hard to say I'm an expert at any one thing. I like to think of my self as the Jack of all Technical Trades. Rather than trying to convey the extent of my technical expertise over a personal website, allow me instead to convey the tools of the trade I most enjoy working with.</p>
           </div>
           <div class="col span-1-of-2 tech-text">
                <p>Since graduation, I've been self training as an entry level full stack engineer. Below are mostly technologies I've had a reasonable amount of exposure to and tinker with on a weekly basis, but also a hand full of technologies I'm currently studying and plan on being competent with very soon.</p>
                <p>The most interesting areas I'm pursuing are Big Data, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Data Science is our means of deriving useful knowledge from data so vast it's impossible to navigate. And the only thing more awesome than a well oiled digital machine is one that can oil itself.</p>

               <h3>Waldo</h3>
               <p>Waldo was my Senior Capstone Project at university. It's a GPS prototype that utilizes an array of other modules on an Arduino microcontroller to log travel measurements into a .CSV file. The utilities can be endless, but I utilize it to walk my dog and record his speeds and map the path we took during the walk.</p>
